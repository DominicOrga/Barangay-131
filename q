    Use JSON to store preferences rather than Preferences API
    
    The Preferences API is a good candidate to store setting
    preferences. However, the data is stored in the registers. Manual
    creation of registry keys are needed before the API can properly
    function, making it unsuitable for a system that will be handed
    to clients with no customer support.
    
    Making use of JSON as a workaround.

    General controller to handle image manipulation
    
    WebcamCapture Control only works with 'take photo' feature of the
    resident.
    
    Create Photoshop control which will be the combination of
    WebcamCaptureControl (Take Picture with webcam)
    and SignatureAmendControl (Filters signature to remove background),
    and cropping features. Thus, it will serve as the universal
    control for all image manipulation.
    
    This controller is still under testing and development.

    Fix label selection limited to 0 - 39 residents.
    
    Wtf. I've been working the whole day creating the resident selection
    mechanism and I only just realized that selecting a label from the
    resident list paging is limited to only displaying the data of
    40 residents, particularly 0 - 39 residents. Created an integer
    that will calculate the 'real' index of the resident in the label
    selected. Thus, the index is not limited only to the values of 0 and 39.
    
    Also, mResidentSelectedIndex is renamed to mLabelSelectedIndex due
    to the fact that it represents the index (0 - 39) of each labels.
